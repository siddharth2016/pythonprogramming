Welcome to the beginning of the first part of this `PyGame` tutorial where we are going to build a game using Python's `pygame` module from scratch.

This series is for the people who are just getting started with `PyGame` and want to build something from scratch.

## Prerequisites

You will need the basic knowledge of Python to get started with this series. If you are just starting out we will recommend our Python beginner series.

>>>>>> Link to beginner series.

## Hands-on

This tutorial is going to take the hands-on approach so that you can follow this tutorial.

So, I would recommend you to not just only read the tutorial but also do it together. That way you will learn more. 

## Why pygame?

### Very easy to start with

Since with `pygame` you use Python as your programming language, it is fairly easy to start with. With pygame, you don't have to create a ton of different files just to create a simple game.

You can write the whole game in a single file.

### Sharing your game

You can share your game just by creating an executable file and sharing it with the people. They can just start playing it by installing it. 

## Installing requirements

We can directly install `pygame` using pip.

```shell
pip install pygame
```

Hope you are as excited to get started as much as we are.
